      The symbols of the Kalush Orchestra's victory at Eurovision will now help
      make Ukraine's victory in the war with the Russian occupiers. The band
      auctions the Eurovision Glass Mic Trophy awarded to the winner of
      Eurovision 2022 to collect donations to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
      <br />
      <br />
      The representatives of the ENKO label Kalush Orchestra with the song
      Stefania won Eurovision 2022 with a total score of 631 points by a large
      margin. This is the third victory of Ukraine at Eurovision and the first
      song written entirely in the Ukrainian language. With such voting,
      Europeans supported not only the Kalush Orchestra but Ukraine in general.
      The country is currently fighting against russian occupiers for its
      freedom, independence, democracy, and peace.

      Itâ€™s noteworthy that the first attempt to mint the NFT trophy "Crystal
      Microphone" belongs to Ukraine. It is also the world's first auction with
      the Eurovision winner's cup.

      <br />
      The raffle initiative is supported by the Ministry of Culture and
      Information Policy, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, and
      the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the association of broadcasters
      that organizes the international Eurovision Song Contest.
